# The Rabbit Question

I was asked this question a long time ago at one of my first interviews out of college and it has stuck with me
ever since. I personally think it's a great question because it gives you an opportunity, as an interviewer, to
see how the candidate thinks and also opens up many avenues of discussion.

## First, the setup

There is a rabbit (or other hopping animal you can draw) at the bottom of a set of stairs. The rabbit can hop up
one step at a time to reach the top, or he can hop up two steps at a time. How many different combinations of hops
are there for n steps. Write an algorithm to calculate the number of hop combinations for n steps.

Example - 4 steps

1-1-1-1 = 4  
2-1-1 = 4  
1-2-1 = 4  
1-1-2 = 4  
2-2 = 4

So for 4 steps, there are 5 possible different combinations of 1-2 hops to reach the top.
